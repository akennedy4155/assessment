# Congratulations, Alex Kennedy!

Congratulations for making it to this part of the interview process. To get a hands-on idea of your current skillset, we'd like for you to perform some SQL and Python exercises and trust that this part of the process will be as enjoyable as it would be for us.

# SQL

For the SQL exercises, please view `Exercises.SQL.md` in your Markdown viewer of choice for more information. It's very simple/straightforward.

# Python

For the Python exercises, it's a bit more involved (but not by much).

[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) is a great tool for (most commonly) interactively running Python code on data and providing embedded Markdown documentation. If you have a local Jupyter instance/setup (or have an interest in going through the process of setting one up), feel free to use it. Otherwise, we've outlined a process below that should work really well for you.

Alternatively, feel free to write standalone Python code that can be executed via the CLI. We think pretty highly of the Notebook-based approach, though, and believe that you'll enjoy that approach, too.

Here's a process that you can use with Try Jupyter to get up and running:

1. [https://jupyter.org/try](https://jupyter.org/try)
1. Select ***Try Classic Notebook***
1. Once your Jupyter instance comes up, open the ***File => Open...*** menu option and upload the following files that we've included:
    * `Exercises.Jupyter.ipynb`
    * `show_titles.csv`
1. Once uploaded, open `Exercises.Jupyter.ipynb`. If you've since left the ***Files*** tab, you can return via ***File => Open...***
1. Select the ***Cell => Run All*** menu option to execute the current statements in the notebook and initialize everything. If you run into errors, ensure that you've uploaded the correct files.
1. Read through the Notebook and follow the instructions

Once you're done with the exercises, use ***File => Download as => Notebook (.ipynb)*** to download a copy of your notebook. Include this downloaded file in your submissions back to HealthMine.

# Solution Submission

To submit, just combine all of your work (.ipynb Notebook file and collection of queries) into a single archive (zip, tar, etc.) and email the archive to jason.cone@healthmine.com. We're not picky about file organization - just don't make it too difficult for us to identify what's what.

Once we've had a chance to review your work, we'll be in touch to discuss next steps.
